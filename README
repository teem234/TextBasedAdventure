Text based adventure command line game.

When run, the game with generate a 7 x 5 map with random events located on each tile.
The size of the map can be changed easily by giving integer values to the Gamecontroller constructor in
the main.cpp file.

The player character always starts on the upper left of the map, while the boss is lower right furthest point.
Each turn player can navigate right,down,up,left as long as it is a valid direction.
Events include shops where players can purchase potions, chests that either buff or debuff the player, empty spaces
and combat encounters where the player engages in a turn based fight with the RNG enemies.

In combat the player can use items, Attack in 3 different ways, or attempt to flee the encounter.

When levels are entered (if the level is not already cleared or empty) a function will be called to start the
specific event of the level.

Game is over if player dies or defeats the boss.
